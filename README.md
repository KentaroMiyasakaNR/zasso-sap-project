We have developed an app that allows students to learn about the importance of biodiversity through hands-on experiences. This app identifies plant species from photos taken during field trips and enables students to create a map of local plants. By comparing current data with historical data, students can visually understand changes or declines in biodiversity.

To address this challenge, weâ€™ve integrated "gairAI" to provide a real-world experiential learning solution. During field trips, students take pictures of plants, and the app analyzes and identifies the species. This interactive process not only makes learning enjoyable but also fosters a deeper interest in the natural environment and encourages information sharing among peers.

This project is significant because it helps educate students on the importance of biodiversity conservation. Through data-driven learning, students can perceive environmental issues as personally relevant, which fosters a greater awareness and responsibility toward building a sustainable future.
